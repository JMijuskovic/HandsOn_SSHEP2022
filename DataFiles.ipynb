    "### Recording the data\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, there happens about billion particle collision in the CMS in one second and it is impossible to record all data from these collisions. Therefore, right after a collision trigger system will decide whether the collision has been potentially interesting or not. Non-interesting collision will not be recorded. This multi-staged triggering process reduces the amount of recorded collisions from billion to about thousand collisions per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collected from collisions will be saved to AOD (Analysis Object Data) files that can be opened with the ROOT program (https://root.cern.ch/). Structures of the files are very complicated so those can't be handled for example in simple data tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise a CSV (comma-separated-values) file format is used instead of the AOD format. A CSV file is a regular text file that contains different values separated with commas. These files can be easily read and handled with the Python programming language."

    "### Indirect detection of particles\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every particle can be detected directly with the CMS or other particle detectors. Often, processes of interest are short-lived. These processes can be detected indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the Z boson, the particle that mediates weak interaction, can't be detected directly with the CMS since the lifetime of the Z is very short.\n",
    "That means that the Z boson will decay before it even reaches the silicon detector of the CMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we detect Z boson?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indirect way of detecting Z boson is by detecting particles that originate from the decay of the Z boson.\n",
    "Z boson has many decay channel, but in todays' exercise we will consider only decay of the Z boson to the muon and antimuon pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important note is that the events with detected muon and antimuon pair are not all originating from Z boson. Therefore, different selections need to be applied in order to reconstruct Z boson. \n",
